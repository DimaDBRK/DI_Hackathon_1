Extraordinary project! Winning the Hackathon was well deserved! Congrats!!!
Your application of Tkinter as a UI is remarkable! 
You not only used all the concepts we've learned in class, but you also exceeded expectations by implementing user registration, 
which shows your high proficiency in database organization and manipulation. 
I also loved the API. One area you could improve is using more OOP for cleaner and more Pythonic code.
